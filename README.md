TensorFlow (deep learning/numerical computing library) is used for deep learning and neural network models. 
Tensorflow allows us to gain insights into unstructured data and how neural networks work.

Tensor flow:
* has pre-built in deep learning models
* writes fast deep learning code in Python
* enables whole stack, preprocess, modeling, deployment
* originally designed and used by Google
* is open source now
